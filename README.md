# kservices
query evaluation and problem solving services in K

The [k](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/kservices/blob/develop/k) script will run solver services from the command line.  It assumes that the this repository is cloned in a `$HOME/git` directory, that maven and java are installed, and that the `develop` branches following repositories are also checked out into `$HOME/git`:
  * [K](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/K/tree/develop)
  * [bae](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/bae/tree/develop)
  * [util](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/util/tree/develop)
  * [sysml](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/sysml/tree/develop)
  
A web-based IDE for K is slowly under construction: [k_webeditor](https://github.jpl.nasa.gov/mbee-dev/k_webeditor).

These websites may be available to try out: 
  * http://theklanguage.com (server from the K repository; has documentation, but running may be broken.)
  * http://flipper.jpl.nasa.gov:8080/ (the IDE under construction; JPL only; behavior and Java extensions; no documenation)
